Someday I will be a son of a gun
Either that or I'll be on the run

If your stuck inside and you see the sky
Teach yourself and learn how to fly
in the sun.

Please God help me fly or get down.


I hit the ground and I'm all beat up
This time I think that 'm out of luck

But someday soon your ship comes in
You will find you learned to swim
and not drown.

Please God help me fly or get down.


Don't get me wrong I'm a happy man.
I Do my thing, doing what I can.

But no one hears all the tunes you play.
So shout all the things you want to say
let's hear sound.

Please God help me fly or get down.


The moral here is when your on your own.
Your stuck inside your mind megaphone.

You got the dream you're about to fly
Believe yourself and give it a try

and have fun.

Please God help me fly or get down.
